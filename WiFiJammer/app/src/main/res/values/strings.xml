        <big>Firmware Installation Required</big>\n\nTo use this app, you need an Android Smartphone
        with a Broadcom BCM4339 Wi-Fi chip running firmware version 6.37.34.43. This is for example
        the case, when using a Nexus 5 with stock firmware version M4B30Z.\n\nIf and only if the
        above requirement evaluates to true, you may continue to install the jamming firmware. Keep
        in mind that this firmware might damage your hardware and will void your hardware\'s
        warranty. You use the firmware as well as this app at your own risk and responsibility. By
        using our firmware and this app, you agree that you will not hold any of the Nexmon
        developers responsible for any harm that results from using any of our tools.\n\nIn the
        following you may create a backup of the original firmware that copies the firmware file
        from /vendor/firmware/fw_bcmdhd.bin to /sdcard/fw_bcmdhd.orig.bin. Once copied, you may
        continue to install the jamming firmware. To revert to the original firmware, you have to
        manually remount your system partition writable and then copy the backup to its original
        location.\n\n
